# iannis.io

This repository holds the contents of my personal website, hosted at
[iannis.io](https://iannis.io).

My website is built using my
[static page compiler](https://github.com/iannisdezwart/page-compiler).

## Compilation

```sh
node compiler
```

Generates a `root` directory which is the webroot of the website.
Use your favourite server to serve the contents of this directory.
Why would you actually host a mirror my website? I don't know.
